                Whether you are a beginner learning the fundamentals or an experienced player looking to improve, this platform contains the frame data for all of the current
                playable characters. Understanding the frame data for your main character as well as others can help you assess when to punish a whiff or to simply just hold 
                block. Knowing the properties of a move can help you take your game to the next level!

                Not sure on the active frames on Ryu's Shoryuken or the recovery on Zangief's SPD? Forgot how to do Dee Jay's super art combos? Included within is the frame data 
                for every moves startup, active, and recovery frames. In addition to that are the inputs for each characters move list. So 
                if you forget how to do a certain move, it's there just in case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes we need more information on the frame data. Throw your questions in on the message board and everyone is welcome to share their thoughts and give more 
                insight on something you may not be familiar with. We are here to help, share our tips, and improve together!
            </p>

                Whether you are practicing in the training room and wanting to learn every moves frame data, this platform can help you with that. Or if you need a quick check 
                on something specific before a match or in between rounds this is an effective tool to assist you in your gameplay!
