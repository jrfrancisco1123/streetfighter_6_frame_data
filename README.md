# streetfighter_6_frame_data
Flask app containing the frame data of the playable characters in Street Fighter 6

I'm a huge fan of the Street Fighter franchise and I wanted to create an app that can help players refer to frame data when needed. The intention of this app is to help those interested in learning the game
in a different way that some may not be familiar with or to use it as a tool to build knowledge around character abilities and what moves are prioritized over others. The app contains a full list of every
playable characters frame data such as normal moves, unique attaacks, super arts, etc...

Street Fighter 6 will continue to grow and expand as new characters will be released as well as changes to the characters frame data. I plan on adding more content and other addtional frame data as well that can provide 
more insight and more information for each character later down the line.
