# streetfighter_6_frame_data
Flask app containing the frame data of the playable characters in Street Fighter 6

I'm a huge fan of the Street Fighter franchise and I wanted to create an app that can help players refer to frame data when needed. The intention of this app is to help those interested in learning the game
in a different way that some may not be familiar with or to use it as a tool to build knowledge around a character abilities and what moves are prioritized over others. The app contains frame data of all the current 
playable characters in tables such as normal moves, unique attacks, super arts, etc...

Street Fighter 6 will continue to grow and expand as new characters will be released as well as changes to the characters frame data. I plan on adding more content and other addtional frame data as well that can provide 
more insight and more information for each character later down the line.
